Flag Boot is a fast, modern, light, type-safe microservice architecture for Scala.

## Why Flag Boot?

Flag Boot makes it easy to develop and deploy your microservices.It provides a set of simple tools for functional programming based on category theory.
Compared with the existing microservice architectures, Flag Boot has the following features:

- Flag Boot is an **extremely simple and lightweight** framework. We hope that any developer with basic computer knowledge can easily design, develop and deploy microservices with Flag Boot.
- Flag Boot provides developers with advanced native **asynchronous** development tools, which makes it unnecessary for developers to configure and tune thread pools during development.
- The **concurrency performance** of Flag Boot is excellent. In simple responsive web service testing, the test result of Flag Boot is better than that of Spring Boot.
- Flag Boot is **explicit** rather than implicit, which makes Flag Boot projects more readable.
