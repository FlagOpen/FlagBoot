        # from upstream until the buffer exceeds this size. That means that the buffer may hold
        # slightly more bytes than this limit (at most one element more). It can be set to 0

        # In addition to the buffering described for property write-buffer-size, try to collect
        # more consecutive writes from the upstream stream producers.
        #
        # The rationale is to increase write efficiency by avoiding separate small
        # writes to the network which is expensive to do. Merging those writes together
        # (up to `write-buffer-size`) improves throughput for small writes.
        #
        # The idea is that a running stream may produce multiple small writes consecutively
        # in one go without waiting for any external input. To probe the stream for
        # data, this features delays sending a write immediately by probing the stream
        # for more writes. This works by rescheduling the TCP connection stage via the
        # actor mailbox of the underlying actor. Thus, before the stage is reactivated
        # the upstream gets another opportunity to emit writes.
        #
        # When the stage is reactivated and if new writes are detected another round-trip
        # is scheduled. The loop repeats until either the number of round trips given in this
        # setting is reached, the buffer reaches `write-buffer-size`, or no new writes
        # were detected during the last round-trip.
        #
        # This mechanism ensures that a write is guaranteed to be sent when the remaining stream
        # becomes idle waiting for external signals.
        #
        # In most cases, the extra latency this mechanism introduces should be negligible,
        # but depending on the stream setup it may introduce a noticeable delay,
        # if the upstream continuously produces small amounts of writes in a
        # blocking (CPU-bound) way.
        #
        # In that case, the feature can either be disabled, or the producing CPU-bound
        # work can be taken off-stream to avoid excessive delays (e.g. using `mapAsync` instead of `map`).
